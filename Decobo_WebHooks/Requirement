I have a new project for you. We have started using a new Learning Management System (LMS) called Docebo.

In Docebo we will offer 200+ courses.  We want to record details of those courses in Saleforce, and also then when a student is enrolled in a course, we want to store the enrolment in that course.

Similar to what we are already doing in SF with Accounts, Products (courses), Opportunities (enrolments).

However – these new courses are in addition to the existing, and they are different type of course, we are calling a “CPD Activity”, so we are going to store the courses and enrolments in two new objects.

Docebo has Web Hooks we can configure for each of the different actions inside Docebo.

We need you to write Salesforce Endpoints for the web hooks to process the updates etc and store the data in Salesforce.
